> **Bridging Engineering Excellence and Risk Management for AI/ML Systems**

A comprehensive, production-ready framework for implementing **Governance-as-Code** for AI/ML models, aligned with **SR 11-7** (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management) and modern DevOps practices.

## 🎯 Overview

The AI Governance Starter Kit enables organizations to:

- **Track and manage** all AI/ML models through a centralized registry
- **Enforce risk-based controls** via automated CI/CD gates
- **Validate code quality** with structural and logic auditing
- **Ensure compliance** with regulatory requirements (SR 11-7, GDPR, etc.)
- **Bridge the gap** between engineering teams and risk management

### What is Governance-as-Code?

**Governance-as-Code** applies Infrastructure-as-Code principles to AI governance:

```
Traditional Governance          →    Governance-as-Code
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Manual reviews                  →    Automated validation
Spreadsheet tracking            →    Version-controlled registry
Ad-hoc compliance checks        →    CI/CD-integrated gates
Siloed documentation           →    Executable policies
Reactive risk management       →    Proactive prevention
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Automated** - Policies enforced automatically in every deployment
- ✅ **Auditable** - Complete history tracked in version control
- ✅ **Repeatable** - Consistent governance across all models
- ✅ **Scalable** - Supports hundreds of models without manual overhead
- ✅ **Collaborative** - Engineers and risk teams work from the same source of truth

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Model Registration

Register your AI/ML model in `inventory/model_registry.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  - model_id: "your-model-id"
    name: "Your Model Name"
    version: "1.0.0"
    
    # Ownership
    owner:
      team: "Your Team"
      contact: "team@example.com"
      technical_lead: "lead@example.com"
    
    # Risk classification
    risk_tier: "medium"  # low, medium, high, critical
    
    # Model lineage
    lineage:
      training_data:
        - name: "training_dataset"
          version: "2024-Q1"
          source: "data-warehouse/path"
      framework: "scikit-learn"
      framework_version: "1.3.0"
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration

The risk gate workflow automatically runs on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests modifying models or registry
- Manual workflow dispatch

```yaml
# .github/workflows/risk-gate.yml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'models/**'
      - 'inventory/model_registry.yaml'
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

### 3. Code Validation

Configure code auditing rules in `validation/structural/code_scalpel_config.yaml`:

```yaml
analysis_rules:
  structural:
    - rule_id: "STR-001"
      name: "Model Class Structure"
      severity: "high"
      check:
        type: "pattern"
        pattern: "class.*Model.*:|def (fit|predict)\\("
```

## 📊 SR 11-7 Compliance

### What is SR 11-7?

**SR 11-7** (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management) is regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Reserve and OCC that establishes standards for model risk management in financial institutions.

### Key Requirements

| SR 11-7 Requirement | Implementation in This Kit |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Model Inventory** | `inventory/model_registry.yaml` tracks all models with metadata |
| **Risk Classification** | Risk tiers (low/medium/high/critical) with automated controls |
| **Model Validation** | Automated validation in CI/CD pipeline |
| **Documentation** | Model cards, technical docs, validation reports |
| **Ongoing Monitoring** | Performance tracking, drift detection, review schedules |
| **Governance Structure** | Approval workflows, stakeholder roles, escalation paths |

### Risk Tier Framework

```yaml
risk_tiers:
  critical:
    description: "Direct regulatory reporting or systemic risk"
    validation_frequency: "monthly"
    required_approvals: ["CRO", "Compliance", "Model Validation"]
    
  high:
    description: "Material impact on financial decisions"
    validation_frequency: "quarterly"
    required_approvals: ["Model Validation", "Compliance", "Business Owner"]
    
  medium:
    description: "Supporting decision-making tools"
    validation_frequency: "semi-annual"
    required_approvals: ["Technical Lead", "Model Validator"]
    
  low:
    description: "Minimal business impact"
    validation_frequency: "annual"
    required_approvals: ["Technical Lead"]
```

    H --> J[Bias & Fairness Checks]
    I --> K[Generate Compliance Report]
    J --> K
    K --> L[Deployment Decision]
```

## 🔐 Security and Compliance Features

### Automated Checks

The risk gate workflow performs:

1. **Schema Validation** - Ensures all required fields are present
2. **Risk Assessment** - Classifies models by risk tier
3. **Documentation Check** - Verifies required documentation exists
4. **Bias Testing** - Confirms fairness testing was performed
5. **Code Quality** - Runs structural analysis on model code
6. **Deployment Gate** - Blocks high-risk deployments without approval

### Code Auditing Rules

The code scalpel configuration includes rules for:

- **Data Governance** - PII detection, data validation, retention policies
- **Logic Auditing** - Random seeds, error handling, hard-coded thresholds
- **Security** - SQL injection, pickle usage, credential detection
- **Fairness** - Protected attributes, fairness metrics, proxy variables

### Example: Risk Gate in Action

```bash
# Developer commits model changes
git add models/credit-risk-v2.py
git commit -m "Update credit risk model"
git push

# CI/CD pipeline runs automatically
✅ Validate Model Registry
✅ Risk Assessment
⚠️  HIGH-RISK MODEL DETECTED

🛑 DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED
High-risk models require additional approval:
- Model Validation Team
- Compliance Officer
- Risk Management

Required Documentation:
✓ Model card
✓ Validation report
✓ Risk assessment
⏳ Awaiting approval
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Jobs

The `risk-gate.yml` workflow includes six jobs:

1. **validate-registry** - Validates YAML syntax and required fields
2. **risk-assessment** - Classifies models by risk tier
3. **model-validation** - Runs automated tests and checks
4. **risk-gate** - Blocks high-risk deployments
5. **compliance-report** - Generates governance reports
6. **notify** - Sends stakeholder notifications

### Code Scalpel Configuration

The code auditing tool checks for:

```yaml
# Example rules
analysis_rules:
  data_governance:
    - rule_id: "DATA-001"
      name: "PII Detection"
      severity: "critical"
      # Flags potential PII handling
  
  security:
    - rule_id: "SEC-003"
      name: "Credentials in Code"
      severity: "critical"
      # Blocks hard-coded credentials
  
  fairness:
    - rule_id: "FAIR-001"
      name: "Protected Attributes"
      severity: "high"
      # Flags use of sensitive attributes
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding Custom Rules

Extend the code scalpel configuration:

```yaml
custom_rules:
  - rule_id: "CUSTOM-001"
    name: "Company-Specific Pattern"
    description: "Your custom check"
    severity: "medium"
    check:
      type: "pattern"
      pattern: "your_pattern_here"
```

### Adjusting Risk Thresholds

Modify risk tier definitions in `model_registry.yaml`:

```yaml
risk_tiers:
  custom_tier:
    description: "Your custom tier"
    validation_frequency: "your_frequency"
    required_approvals: ["Your approvers"]
```

### Integration with External Systems

The framework supports integration with:

- **ServiceNow** - Approval workflows
- **PagerDuty** - Incident notifications
- **Jira** - Issue tracking
- **Slack/Email** - Team notifications
- **Monitoring** - Datadog, Prometheus, etc.

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Deploying a Low-Risk Model

```bash
# 1. Register model
vim inventory/model_registry.yaml
# Add model with risk_tier: "low"

# 2. Commit and push
git add inventory/model_registry.yaml
git commit -m "Register new recommendation model"
git push

# 3. CI/CD runs automatically
✅ Registry validated
✅ Risk: Low
✅ Validation passed
✅ Auto-deployed to staging
```

### Example 2: Deploying a High-Risk Model

```bash
# 1. Register model
vim inventory/model_registry.yaml
# Add model with risk_tier: "high"

# 2. Commit and push
git add inventory/model_registry.yaml
git commit -m "Register credit scoring model"
git push

# 3. CI/CD runs
✅ Registry validated
⚠️  Risk: High
✅ Validation passed
🛑 Deployment blocked - requires approval

# 4. Obtain approvals
# - Model Validation Team reviews
# - Compliance approves
# - Risk Management signs off

# 5. Manual deployment after approvals
# (with proper authorization)
```

## 🤝 Best Practices

1. **Keep Registry Updated** - Update `model_registry.yaml` for every model change
2. **Document Thoroughly** - Maintain model cards and technical documentation
3. **Test Before Deploying** - Run validation tests locally before pushing
4. **Review Risk Tiers** - Regularly reassess model risk classifications
5. **Monitor in Production** - Set up monitoring and alerting for deployed models
6. **Automate Everything** - Leverage CI/CD for consistent governance

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Do I need to use all components?**  
A: No, you can adopt incrementally. Start with the model registry, then add CI/CD gates, then code auditing.

**Q: Is this only for financial institutions?**  
A: No, while SR 11-7 is for financial services, the framework applies to any organization deploying AI/ML models.

**Q: How does this integrate with existing MLOps tools?**  
A: The framework is designed to complement tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker, etc. Use the registry as your source of truth.

**Q: Can I use this for non-Python models?**  
A: Yes! The framework is language-agnostic. Customize the code scalpel config for R, Java, Scala, etc.

## 🧪 Testing

To test the framework:

```bash
# Validate registry YAML
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('inventory/model_registry.yaml'))"

# Run workflow locally (requires act)
act -j validate-registry
